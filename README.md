## Task Description ##  

The task is to implement an API for potential clients. The API will have minimum 2 endpoints. 
One end-point should return the top 10 bus lines in Stockholm area with most bus stops on their route. 
The other endpoint should return a list of every bus stop of the bus line provided. 
There is no requirement on how the bus stops are sorted.  
 
To accomplish the task please use the Trafiklabâ€™s open API (https://www.trafiklab.se). 
You can find more information about the specific API at the documentation page: http://www.trafiklab.se/api/sl-hallplatser-och-linjer-2.  
 
You can register your own account at Trafiklab and obtain an API key. 
 
The data should be automatically gathered from API for each run of the application.
